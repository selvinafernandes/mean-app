## Todo Project

<p>This project is created using Angular 5. It will help you create an new todo list and separate todo tasks for each list. The logic for authentication and adding new name to a list is still not in place but you can add using the + button. You can go past the login form by entering any details to get to the list</p>

## Steps to install

1. Git clone the repo and `cd` into it.
2. Run `npm install` and `npm start` to run the project
3. Start creating the todo lists and tasks, deleting and updating.
